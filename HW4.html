<center><h1>CS40 Graphs: Temperature Anomalies</h1></center>
<center><h6>For Homework 4, I decided to create graphs on temperature anomalies.</h6></center>


<center><div style="background-color:#edc4c4"><h3>Global Temperature Anomaly</h3></div>
	<p> 
		The temperature anomaly compares the average temperature from 1880-2015 to that of 1901-2000, but only the last years are presented in the bar graph below. 
	If you want to take a look at the orginal data source, you can find that <a href="https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/cag/global/time-series/globe/land_ocean/ytd/12/1880-2016.json">here</a>. The global temperature anomaly 
	in 2007 was 0.62 degrees Celsius. In 2016, the temperature anomaly raised to a total of 0.99 degrees Celsius. In only 10 years, the temperature anomaly 
	has risen by a total of 0.37 degrees Celsius.

<center><div style="background-color:#edc4c4"><h3>US Annual Average Temperature and Anomaly</h3></div>
	<p> 
		The temperature anomaly compares the average temperature from 1880-2015 to that of 1901-2000, but only the last years are presented in the line graph below.
	To accomadate for the laarge difference in values, the chart contains to y axises.
	If you want to take a look at the orginal data source, you can find that <a href="https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/cag/national/time-series/110-tavg-ytd-12-1895-2016.json?base_prd=true&begbaseyear=1901&endbaseyear=2000">here</a>. 
	The US annual temperature in December of 2007 was 53.65 degrees Fahrenheit, making the anomaly 1.63 degrees Fahrenheit. 
	In December of 2016, the average temperature in the US raised to a total of 54.92 degrees Fahrenheit, raising the temperature anomaly 
	to 2.90 degrees Fahrenheit. In only 10 years, the temperature has risen by _______ degrees Fahrenheit and the anomlay has grown by ____ dgrees Fahrenheit.

<!-- you should have a short 2-5 sentence description that describes the data you plotted

the description should include a link to the original data source-->
