<p>
Take trip down memory lane with me. Or, if you don't know me that well, let's take a look at who I used to be and the experiences that make me who I am today.
</p>

<p>
	I was born and raised in <a href="https://www.santa-ana.org/">Santa Ana, California</a>. I went to a school called Phillips Academy in Andover, Massachusetts. I now attend Claremont McKenna College in Claremont, CA.
