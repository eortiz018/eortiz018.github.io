Take trip down memory lane with me. Or, if you don't know me that well, let's take a look at who I used to be and the experiences that make me who I am today.

	I was born and raised in <a href="https://www.santa-ana.org/">Santa Ana, California</a> which is about 45 minutes away from Claremont. I loved California and most of my family lives here. The other half lives in Mexico. My family is made up of my mom, Cristy, my dad, Tony, and my borther, Ivan. 
</p>

<p>
	I went to elementary at John Muir Fundamental Elementary School and then attended Gonzalo and Felicitas Mendez Fundamental Intermediate School. The schools weren't fantastic, but I always loved reading and going to school. I had some great teachers there too.  
</p>

<p>
	I went to a high school called Phillips Academy in Andover, Massachusetts through a program called A Better Chance. I now attend Claremont McKenna College in Claremont, CA.
