    I really like this thread because it echoes the comment before it. It agrees that Donald Trump is a traitor. Plus, the comment is short and sweet. Straight to the point!

    Dear Professor Izbicki, 

    I believe my score should be 80. 

    Since bot.py has eight tasks, worth ten points each, I believe I have earned 70 points total.

    I completed extra credit #1 and #2, both of which are worth five points. Lastly, I attempted to complete the extra credit worth 25 points. 
    Because I had issues with the initial code, I couldn't run it to see if it worked, but I hope to get at least a few points. Sorry about the state of the HW! Thank you so much for your help anyways!
