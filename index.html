<h3>WOA Trip</h3>
<p> 
The day after we moved in, we had to wake up early as heck to go on our Welcome Orientation Adventure Trip. I had decided to get out of my comfort zone and sign up for white water rafting. I was a little scared, but mostly excited. What I didn't know (until Sahil mentioned it during move in day) was that we would be going up to the American River which was an 8 to 10 hour bus ride. Considering that cars and I historically don't have a good relationship, I would have never chosen rafting had I known. However, I'm glad I did it anyways
